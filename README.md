# ML-PROJECT

🧠 Overview

This project is an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using the customtkinter library. It allows users to:

Upload data files (CSV or Excel)

Explore and visualize data

Perform preprocessing steps (cleaning, outlier removal, encoding, etc.)

Train various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, KMeans)

Display evaluation results such as accuracy and confusion matrix
